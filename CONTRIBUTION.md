# Contributing to the Bootcamp

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome all contributions, from fixing a typo to adding a new feature. To ensure a smooth and effective collaboration, please take a moment to read this guide.</br>

For creating an environment, where everyone works together look at the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## How to Contribute

### 1. **Check for Existing Issues**
Before you start working, check the **Issues** tab to see if a similar issue or feature request already exists. If it does, you can add your thoughts to the existing discussion. If not, feel free to open a new issue to discuss your proposed changes. This helps prevent duplicate work and ensures that your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

### 2. **Fork the Repository**
To get started, **fork** this repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the project where you can safely make changes without affecting the main repository.

### 3. **Create a New Branch**
Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work organized and makes it easier to manage different contributions. A good practice is to name your branch something descriptive, like `fix-typo-readme` or `add-new-feature-xyz`.

### 4. **Make Your Changes**
Make your changes in your new branch. This could be anything from fixing a bug to adding a new function.

* **Provide Sources:** If your contribution uses information or code from an external source, please **provide a link or reference** to the original material. This acknowledges the original creator and helps others verify the information.

* **Ensure Code Works:** If you submit code, examples, or scripts, please **test them thoroughly** to ensure they work as expected. We want to make sure all contributions are functional and reliable.

* **Label Broken Code:** In cases where an example is provided to demonstrate a problem or a work-in-progress, please **clearly label it as non-functional**. For instance, you can add comments like `# This code is not working yet` or add a note in the accompanying text.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**
Once your changes are complete, **commit** them with a clear and concise message. A good commit message explains what you did and why. For example, "Fix: Corrected typo in README.md" is better than just "update file."

### 6. **Open a Pull Request**
After committing your changes, go to your forked repository on GitHub and open a **pull request** (PR). A pull request is how you propose your changes to be merged into the main project.

In your pull request description, please:
* Reference the related issue number (e.g., "Closes #123").
* Provide a brief but clear summary of your changes.
* Mention any external sources or references used.

After you open the PR, a maintainer will review your changes and may ask for revisions. Once everything looks good, your contribution will be merged into the project!

Thank you for helping us make this project better!
